# UK Immigration Attitudes Project
• Conducted a statistical analysis using data from the European Social Survey (2023) to examine the relationship between income level and public support for immigration in the UK.

• Built and interpreted an ordinal logistic regression model, controlling for political orientation, age, education, and beliefs about equality, to test the hypothesis that higher income predicts greater immigration support.

• Presented findings in the context of UK immigration policy changes (Home Office White Paper, 2025), identifying key socio-economic predictors of public opinion to inform potential policy implications.
